# Good Practice: INSPIRE download services based on SensorThings API


This repository contains a proposal for a specification for setting up INSPIRE download services based on the new [OGC SensorThingsAPI standard](https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings).

A [draft specification document](/spec/sta-inspire-download.md) has been developed by experts from AT, DE, FR and JRC. The [API4INSPIRE project](), funded by [ELISE]() also contributed to the drafting of the technical specification. It will be submitted for review and testing to experts in the INSPIRE maintenance and implementation expert group (MIG) as well as solution providers who are already providing implementations of the standard. 

The ultimate goal of this activity is to submit the specification as an [INSPIRE good practice document](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/portfolio/good-practice-library) to the INSPIRE MIG for endorsement. 

We therefore encourage INSPIRE implementers and solution providers to test the specification and to provide feedback on the feasibility, existing implementation plans and any issues encountered in this repository through the issue tracker.
